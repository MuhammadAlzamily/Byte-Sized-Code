    "# OOP IN PYTHON  \n",
    "**By Muhammad Kareem**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is OOP ?\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP or object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that helps software developers create more maintainable and scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why OOP ?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, this paradigm solves many problems in writing software as it creates like a \"template\" which other components can use and this helps reduce code and make it easier to maintain and debug if anything goes wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation \n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the creation of self-contained modules that bind processing functions to the data. These user-defined data types are called \"classes,\" and one instance of a class is an \"object.\" For example, in a payroll system, a class could be Manager, and Pat and Jan could be two instances (two objects) of the Manager class. Encapsulation ensures good code modularity, which keeps routines separate and less prone to conflict with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance\n",
    "Classes are created in hierarchies, and inheritance allows the structure and methods in one class to be passed down the hierarchy. That means less programming is required when adding functions to complex systems. If a step is added at the bottom of a hierarchy, only the processing and data associated with that unique step needs to be added. Everything else is inherited. The ability to reuse existing objects is considered a major advantage of object technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    "Object-oriented programming allows procedures about objects to be created whose exact type is not known until runtime. For example, a screen cursor may change its shape from an arrow to a line depending on the program mode. The routine to move the cursor on screen in response to mouse movement would be written for \"cursor,\" and polymorphism allows that cursor to take on whatever shape is required at runtime. It also allows new shapes to be easily integrated."

    "### Example explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what's going on up there ! to define a class in python we first type the keyword *class* followed by the name of the class then we proceed to structure this class as the following\n",
    "Firstly we need to understand what is this `def __init__()` method, this method initializes an instance of the class, now you're still thinking WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN !!!!!!! simply put, a class is a **template** a pre defined unique variable type we decide what it can and can't do and *clark* variable here is a **copy** of that class or template\n",

    "### Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Each class has its own methods which we used to call *functions*, they're the same thing but it's just because they're inside a class we refer to them as *methods* and we're going to look bit deeper into these methods and what's different about them \n",
    "\n",
    "Each method **can't** have empty arguments, they all have a `self` argument as we've seen in the example and we can't ignore that argument because it enables us to access the variables defined within the class which are called *attributes* that each instance of any class has, in our example an object of the class `superman` has these attributes *name* , *age* and *job* which were initialized when we defined the object so in order for a method to access those you have to add the `self` argument just like how we did in our two methods `fly()` and `lift_heavy_stuff()`\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way when we define an object of the child class we will be able to access the parent's class attributes and methods and we won't have to define a new `__init__()` method unless we want to add more attributes to the child class\n",
    "\n",
    "So by default adding the `__init__()` method to the child will overwrite the parent's method so i'll give two examples of how to declare a child class to inherit and also how to inherit the `__init__()` and add to it"

Well it'd be a problem if we did so for that reason we used this `super()` method to inherit the `__init__()` method of the parent and this method automatically figures out which `__init__()` are we talking about in case of multiple classes because it sees which parent class our child class inherited from\n",
    "After we inherited the `__init__()` method which is a default behavior by the way as we saw in the first example, we added a new attribute to the child clas which is the `self.model` \n",
